ldesc: "The JT harness is based on Oracle's JavaTest harness. The JT 
harness is a general purpose, fully-featured, flexible, and configurable 
test harness very well suited for most types of unit testing. Originally 
developed as a test harness to run TCK test suites, it has since evolved 
into a general purpose test platform."
